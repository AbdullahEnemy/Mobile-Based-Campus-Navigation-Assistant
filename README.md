# Mobile-Based-Campus-Navigation-Assistant
This project aims to develop a mobile-based navigation assistant that determines a user's campus location without GPS. Instead, it will use image-based landmark recognition and distance estimation. The final deliverable is a mobile app that identifies buildings and estimates position based on captured images, enabling efficient on-campus navigation
